# Hello world

> Welcome to my home on the Internet!

I'm working as a Global Product Manager, Microsoft Cloud Solutions at Telia Company, living in Sweden, and are in the intersection between business and technology. In my role at Telia Company I'm responsible for scaling and expanding the Azure business area and build up the competence, processes, WoW, and also driving community efforts around Azure and Microsoft 365.

Besides my normal day job I'm trying to share my knowledge by speaking at podcasts, conferences and events.
